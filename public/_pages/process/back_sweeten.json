A dry mead may be too acidic, or a spicy mead too one-dimensional.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Flavorings that rely upon sweetness for context (like honey and fruit) can be delicate or even indistinct. Even a melomel with a large fruit load may be unrecognizable in the absence of sugar. Adjusting the sweetness level can bring these flavors back into focus.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"###Process\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Back sweetening is best done after the mead is mostly clear. Yeast and particulate matter significantly change the flavor of a mead and can throw the balance far off. It's also best to do immediately after racking off the lees, because you'll be stirring the must. There's no reason to re-suspend particulate matter that has already dropped out.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If you don't know your desired sweetness level (a specific gravity reading), take a large sample from the fermenter. Sweeten it in stages (use your hydrometer to measure how sweet) and draw a small sample into a tasting glass each time. For example, you may end up with samples at 1.000 (unchanged), 1.010, 1.020, and 1.030. It can be helpful to remember that you can blend sweetened samples to reach a desired gravity reading. A 1:1 blend of 1.000 and 1.030 samples will yield a sample with a gravity reading of 1.015.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Taste each sample and determine the level of sweetness you desire.

In this example, you could add half of 3.6 pounds of honey (1.8 pounds of honey), discover that the gravity is 1.015 (higher than the expected 1.012-1.013) and then carefully step it up to your desired final gravity without over shooting. \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"It's easy to add more sugar.
