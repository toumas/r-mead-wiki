If you are staggering nutrient additions across the first few days, it is necessary to degas before you make an addition. The nutrient particles provide nucleation points to the dissolved CO2. This works similarly to Diet Coke and Mentos - the result is a mess. Degassing removes this CO2, which in high concentrations will stress your yeast during fermentation.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Initially, you degas your mead as you aerate it - stir the solution vigorously by hand or with a drill and mix-stir attachment.

In a bucket it will simply overflow.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"When aging wine, you can speed up degassing with a vacuum degasser, which works by lowering the air pressure inside the vessel, causing CO2 to more readily come out of the solution. You can also use a wine whip, which is made to agitate the wine below the surface without causing excess oxygen exposure.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Do not ever shake your mead to degas.

For such meads, it is necessary to break the cap, punch it down, and degas often. If you don't, the cap can be pushed out of the fermenter by the gasses building beneath, and the high concentration of CO2 will stress your yeast, causing off flavors.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n","scope":{}}}}
