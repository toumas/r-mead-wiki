Bench trials are most commonly used to evaluate how much acid, tannin, or sweetness to add to a mead in order to achieve balance.

This can be easily and repeatably done by using stock solutions of a known concentration to a fixed volume of mead. \"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"While a brewer can conduct a bench trial alone, it is highly advisable to have at least one other person participate in the trial, as each person's palette is different and having more opinions will help you to make better decisions.

The actual concentration that you will want is dependent on the sample size you choose to use.

Reputable manufacturers of fining agents and powdered tannins will have a recommended dosing range that can be found on the product's web site or on the Technical Data Sheet provided by the manufacturer; this range will usually be expressed in PPM (e.g., 50-200 PPM) or in grams per hectoliter (g/hL). One g/hL is equivalent to 10 PPM.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Generic wine tannins or fining agents may not have a TDS available from the manufacturer and will have either a fixed dose or a recommended range specified on the packaging, usually in grams per gallon (g/gal). Dosing expressed in this way can be converted to PPM by dividing the dose by 0.38 then multiplying by 100 (0.38 g/gal is 100 PPM). For example, for a dose of 1 g/gal, (1/0.38)*100 = 263.1 PPM. If the tannin or fining agent has a fixed dose, a reasonable range can be obtained by using 50% of the dose for the low end, and 150% for the high end, e.g. for a fixed dose of 100 PPM, a reasonable range for bench trials might be 50-150 PPM.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Dosing for acids, sweetness, or other things that do not have a recommended dosing, a 'lazy trial' can be used to ballpark a dosing range. Take a 50ml sample of the mead, and use the 1 or 10ml graduated syringe to add a small amount of stock solution to the sample. Alternate between taking a very small sip and adding a little more stock solution until you think the mead is in the ballpark of what you'd like to achieve with the adjustment.
