Yeast, unfortunately, aren't so great at rationing their supplies and enter a \"feeding frenzy\" in the sudden presence of abundance, causing the speed of `,mdx(\"a\",n({parentName:\"p\"},{href:\"/r/mead/wiki/process/fermentation\"}),\"fermentation\"),' to increase. As fermentation is an exothermic process, this causes the temperature of the must to temporarily spike. The end result of a warmer ferment is an increase in the production of fusel alcohols which are responsible for the \"hot,\" \"jet fuel,\" or \"young\" taste in a new wine.

It is the densest and cheapest source of YAN and yeast strongly prefer it over organic sources. It's too easy to metabolize and causes the largest fermentation spikes. As a result, you may not wish to expose your yeast to it right away. On the other hand, it's completely ineffective in environments over 9% ABV, so it cannot always be used to supplement a sluggish or stuck must late in the process.
