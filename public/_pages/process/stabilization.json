In summary, potassium metabisulfite (k-meta) removes oxygen, resulting in a severely lower yeast population that can reestablish fermentation in time; potassium sorbate (k-sorb) effectively sterilizes any remaining yeast so they cannot reproduce.

As an antioxidant, it helps to protect color and flavor during long aging.

It's available to the homebrewer in two main forms: Campden Tablets and powdered potassium metabisulfite.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Potassium metabisulfite breaks down, dissipates, and loses effectiveness within a few hours of dosing.

Think of Campden Tablets as a pre-measured easy-to-use form of potassium metabisulfite. Since this substance is used in very small quantities and by weight, the tablets are useful if you don't have an accurate gram scale.  A campden tablet provides .44 grams of potassium metabisulfite. You may find Campden Tablets that are made with \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"sodium\"),\" metabisulfite. Check the packaging carefully and avoid these. They work the same, but will leave sodium in your mead instead of potassium, which may affect the flavor in undesirable ways.

When dissolved in water, potassium metabisulfite breaks down into three sulfuric compounds: sulfite, bisulfite, and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Each of these compounds is capable of binding with oxygen molecules which prevents those molecules from oxidizing the mead or being used by yeast and spoilage organisms.  These free sulfites are also capable of binding with other molecules or even evaporating out as gas, which can complicate the dosage. You also need to know that 57% of potassium metabisulfite is free SO2. The rest is already bound or otherwise unusable.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The package-recommended dosage is acceptable but probably excessive. Some people report sensitivity to high sulfite content. It also adds a noticeable bite that can take months to age out. To minimize or avoid these problems, we can tailor the amount of added free SO2 to the specific needs of the mead. To do this, we need to know the pH of the mead after fermentation is complete, and the free SO2 already present in the mead. Note that if you intend to back sweeten after stabilization, you may need to re-check the pH and adjust the SO2 upward again.
