If the liquid is less dense than water, the displaced volume will exert less force against the bulb, and the hydrometer stem will be further submerged. The markings on the stem are a ratio of the density of the liquid being tested to the density of pure water. If the reading is 1.112, the liquid is a multiple of 1.112 times denser than water.
